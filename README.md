## ABOUT

This is a simple guessing game app created to practice JavaScript.

The code is all heavily commented to explain what I have done.

Note: the UI is designed for desktop and will appear broken on smaller devices. Feel free to play around to make it responsive. I may do that myself in future but this is supposed to be JavaScript practice and so the focus is on the functionality NOT on making it responsive. It still looks pretty cool on desktop though if I do say so myself ðŸ™‚
